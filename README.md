## Description

This is a simple python program that uses the OpenCV library to interpret American Sign Language (ASL) letters. The program uses a pre-trained model to recognize the letters and display them on the screen. The program also uses the Pygame library to play a sound when a letter is recognized.

## Installation

To install the program, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Mediapipe
- Tensorflow

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `main.py` file. The program will open a window that displays the camera feed. To use the program, simply hold up your hand and form a letter with your fingers. The program will recognize the letter and display it on the screen. The program will also play a sound that corresponds to the letter that was recognized.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Note

Please use python 3.7 to run the program. The program may not work with other versions of python.
